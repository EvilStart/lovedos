# LoveDOS
A framework for making 2D DOS games in Lua. LoveDOS provides an API based on a
subset of the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) API.

## Getting started
You can download LoveDOS from the
[releases page](https://github.com/rxi/lovedos/releases). If you're not
using DOS as your operating system then [DOSbox](http://www.dosbox.com/) can be
used to emulate a DOS computer.

When you run love.exe it searches for a file named "main.lua" in its current
folder; the code in "main.lua" is then loaded and executed. A small example
program which displays white text on a black background and exits when the
`escape` key is pressed is as follows:

```lua
function love.draw()
  love.graphics.print('Hello World!', 20, 20)
end

function love.keypressed(key)
  if key == "escape" then
    os.exit()
  end
end
```

The [doc/api.md](doc/api.md) file provides a reference and overview of all of
the built-in LoveDOS modules, functions and callbacks.
