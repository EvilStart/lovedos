## Modules

### love

##### love.getVersion()
Returns the version of LoveDOS as a string.

### love.system
Provides access to information about the user's system.

##### love.system.getOS()
Returns the operating system which LoveDOS is running on.

##### love.system.getMemUsage()
Returns the amount of memory in kilobytes which is being used by LoveDOS. This
includes the memory used by both the loaded assets and lua.


### love.graphics
Provides functions for drawing lines, shapes, text and images.

##### love.graphics.getDimensions()
Returns the width and height of the screen in pixels as two numbers.

##### love.graphics.getWidth()
Returns the width of the screen in pixels.

##### love.graphics.getHeight()
Returns the height of the screen in pixels.

##### love.graphics.getBackgroundColor()
Returns the currently set background color.

##### love.graphics.setBackgroundColor([color])
Sets the the background color used when `love.graphics.clear()` is called
without any arguments. If no `color` argument is passed to the function then
the background color is reset to the default.

##### love.graphics.getColor()
Returns the currently set color.

##### love.graphics.setColor([color])
Sets the the color used when drawing. If no `color` argument is passed to the
function then the color is reset to the default.

##### love.graphics.getBlendMode()
Returns the currently set blend mode.

##### love.graphics.setBlendMode([mode])
Sets the current blend mode used by `love.graphics.draw()`. If no `mode`
argument is passed then the blend mode is set to the default (`"normal"`).

Mode        | Description
------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
`"normal"`  | Draws normally with transparency
`"fast"`    | Draws without transparency, this is the fastest blend mode
`"and"`     | Binary ANDs the source and destination pixels
`"or"`      | Binary ORs the source and destination pixels
`"color"`   | Draws opaque pixels using the `love.graphics.setColor()` color

##### love.graphics.getFont()
Returns the current font.

##### love.graphics.setFont([font])
Sets the current font. If `font` is nil then the font is reset to the default.

##### love.graphics.getCanvas()
Returns the current canvas.

##### love.graphics.setCanvas([image])
Sets the current canvas which all the draw operations will draw to. If the
`image` argument is not set then the canvas is reset to the default canvas
representing the user's screen.

##### love.graphics.getFlip()
Returns true if images are set to be horizontally flipped when drawn

##### love.graphics.setFlip([enable])
Set whether images should be horizontally flipped when draw. If `enable` is not
passed then this is set to false by default.

##### love.graphics.reset()
Resets the font, color, background color, canvas, blend mode and flip mode to
their defaults.

##### love.graphics.clear([color])
Clears the screen (or canvas) to the `color`. If no `color` argument is given
then the background color is used.

##### love.graphics.draw(image [, quad], x, y)
Draws the `image` to the screen at the given `x`, `y` position. If a `quad`
argument is provided then the image is clipped to the provided quad when drawn.

##### love.graphics.point(x, y)
Draws a pixel.

##### love.graphics.line(x, y, x2, y2 [, ...])
Draws a line from the positition `x`, `y` to `x2`, `y2`. You can continue
passing point positions to draw a polyline.

##### love.graphics.rectangle(mode, x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectange and the `x`, `y` position of the given `width` and `height`.
`mode` should be either `"fill"` or `"line"`.

##### love.graphics.circle(mode, x, y, radius)
Draws a circle of a given `radius` with its center at the `x`, `y` position.
`mode` should be either `"fill"` or `"line"`.

##### love.graphics.print(text, x, y)
Draws the `text` string in the current font with its top left at the `x`, `y`
position.

##### love.graphics.newImage(filename)
Creates and returns a new image. `filename` should be the name of an image file.
LoveDOS is limited to a palette of 255 unique colors in any given game; it is up
to the user not to exceed this limit.

##### love.graphics.newCanvas([width, height])
Creates and returns a new blank image of the size `width`, `height`. If a
`width` and `height` are not provided then the image will be the same
dimensions as the screen.

##### love.graphics.newQuad(x, y, width, height)
Creates and returns a new quad.

##### love.graphics.newFont([filename])
Creates and returns a new font. `filename` should be the name of a black and
white 8bit .pcx image file representing all 256 characters in a 16 x 16
character grid. If no `filename` is given then the default embedded font image
is used.

##### love.graphics.present()
Flips the current screen buffer with the displayed screen buffer. This is
called automatically after the `love.draw()` callback.


### love.timer
Provides an interface to your system's clock.

##### love.timer.getDelta()
Returns the time between the last two frames.

##### love.timer.getAverageDelta()
Returns the average delta time over the last second.

##### love.timer.getFps()
Returns the current frames per second

##### love.timer.getTime()
Returns the number of seconds since some time in the past. The value returned
by this function should be used only as a comparison with other values returned
by this function.

##### love.timer.step()
Measures the time between two frames. This is automatically called each frame.

##### love.timer.sleep(seconds)
Pauses the thread for the specified number of `seconds`. During this time no
callbacks are called.


### love.keyboard
##### love.keyboard.isDown(code)
Returns true if the key of the given scancode is currently down.


## Objects
### Image
A loaded image or canvas which can be drawn.

##### Image:getDimensions()
Returns the width and height of the image in pixels as two numbers.

##### Image:getWidth()
Returns the width in pixels of the image.

##### Image:getHeight()
Returns the height in pixels of the image.

##### Image:getPixel(x, y)
Returns the color of the pixel at the position `x`, `y` of the image. If the
position is outside of the image then 0 is returned.

##### Image:setPixel(x, y, color)
Sets the pixel of the image at the position `x`, `y` to `color`. If the
position is outside of the image then no change is made.

##### Image:mapPixel(fn)
Takes the function `fn` which is called for each pixel of the image and is
given the arguments `x`, `y` and `color`: The position of the current pixel and
its color. Each pixel will be set to the color returned by this function.


### Quad
A rectangle used to represent the clipping region of an image when drawing.

##### Quad:setViewport(x, y, width, height)
Sets the position and dimensions of the quad

##### Quad:getViewport()
Returns the position (`x`, `y`) and dimensions (`width`, `height`) of the quad,
4 numerical values in total.


### Font
A font used by `love.graphics.print()`. The current font can be set using the
`love.graphics.setFont()` function.

##### Font:getDimensions(text)
Returns the width and height in pixels which the provided `text` string would
take to render.

##### Font:getWidth([text])
Returns the width in pixels which the provided `text` string would take to
render. If no `text` argument is provided, the width of a single character is
returned.

##### Font:getHeight([text])
Returns the height in pixels which the provided `text` string would take to
render. If no `text` argument is provided, the height of a single line is
returned.

##### Font:setCharSpacing(n)
Sets the size of the gap between each character of text in pixels to `n`.

##### Font:setLineSpacing(n)
Sets the size of the gap between each character of text in pixels to `n`.


## Callbacks
##### love.load()
Called when LoveDOS is started.

##### love.update(dt)
Called at the beginning of each frame, `dt` is the amount of time in seconds
which has passed since the last frame. This is where all the game logic should
take place.

##### love.draw()
Called when the frame is ready to be drawn. All your draw calls should take
place in this function.

##### love.keypressed(code)
Called when the user presses a key. `code` is the scancode value for the
pressed key.

##### love.keyreleased(code)
Called when the user releases a key. `code` is the scancode value for the
released key.

##### love.errhand(err)
Called when an unprotected error occurs in any of the callback functions; `err`
is the error message. Setting this function overrides the default error
behaviour of resetting the VGA mode, printing the error and exiting the
program.
